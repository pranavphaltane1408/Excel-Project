# Report Summary:
The hotel booking system shows significant operational challenges, particularly with cancellations and room status management. While the business generates 
substantial revenue, there are clear opportunities for improvement in reducing cancellations and optimizing room allocation. City hotels are performing 
better in terms of both bookings and revenue, suggesting different market dynamics or operational efficiencies between city and resort properties. The seasonal 
patterns indicate a need for dynamic pricing and capacity management strategies throughout the year.

# Recommended Actions:

		1. Cancellation Management :
		Implement stricter cancellation policies, especially during peak seasons
		Consider dynamic deposit requirements based on booking patterns
		Offer incentives for early/direct bookings with lower cancellation rates


		2. Revenue Optimization :
		Develop targeted marketing campaigns for resort hotels to improve their 25% market share
		Create special packages for families to diversify from couple-dominated bookings
		Implement dynamic pricing during high cancellation periods


		3. Operational Improvements:
		Investigate and address the high number of undesired room statuses (43,422)
		Optimize room allocation systems to improve desired vs undesired ratio
		Develop better forecasting models based on seasonal trends


		4. Market Segmentation :
		Create specialized offerings for couples since they're the dominant segment
		Develop more family-friendly packages to grow that segment
		Consider special promotions during low seasons to maintain occupancy
